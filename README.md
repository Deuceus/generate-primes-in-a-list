# generate-primes-in-a-list
function that generates primes in a list [python]

I'm 14 and have been learning python for about 3 weeks as I am writing this (6/16/20). Don't judge if you are reading this in the future and this code is trash. This is the first project I have ever put on GitHub. Feel free to use this function, and make pull requests if you please. I doubt that this code is very efficient, so if you know a better way to generate prime numbers, let me know.
