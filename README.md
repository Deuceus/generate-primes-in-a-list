# generate-primes-in-a-list
function that generates primes in a list [python]

I'm 14 and have been learning python for about 3 weeks as I am writing this (6/16/20). Don't judge if you are reading this in the future and this code is trash. This is the first project I have ever put on GitHub. Feel free to use this function, and make pull requests if you please. I doubt that this code is very efficient, so if you know a better way to generate prime numbers, let me know.

Well now that I have more experience, this program has gotten a huge update. It is September 1, 2020 as I am writing this, and this can now be run from the command line to use multiple mathematical functions.
Here is a list of the functions that this program provides now:

getPrimes
This function will give you a list of primes from a text file within a given range.

primeFactorize
This function will generate the prime factorization of a number based on your text file of primes.

lcm
This function will take a theoretically infinite amount of arguments and return the least common multiple of those numbers.

gcf
This function will take a theoretically infinite amount of arguments and return the greatest common factor of those numbers.

simplifyRadical
This function takes an index and a radicand and will simplify the radical, even if a decimal is input as the radicand. The index must be an integer though.

generateMorePrimes
This function will generate more primes and save them to a text file.
